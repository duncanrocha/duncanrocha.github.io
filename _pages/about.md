Hello! I'm a sixth year physics Ph.D. student from University of Chicago specializing in particle phenomenology. I'm affiliated with the Enrico Fermi Institute ([EFI](https://efi.uchicago.edu/)), as well as the Kavli Insitute for Cosmological Physics ([KICP](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/)). I'm originally from San Francisco, which I miss very much, but am now an avid fan of Chicago (during any season but winter). Outside of physics, I love playing all ball and racket sports, cooking, climbing, and making fun of my friends.

Academic Interests
======
I'm a particle physicist at heart who enjoys working in many different but connected sandboxes. In particular, I like to think about fun and interesting scenarios beyond the Standard Model and their observable consequences in modern experiments, cosmology, and astrophysics. In the past I have worked a lot on dark matter models, for example, leveraging beam dumps like [MiniBooNe](https://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/experiments/intensity/miniboone.html) and [MuonE](https://web.infn.it/MUonE/) to constrain models with long-lived particles in a dark sector. I also enjoy thinking about ways of testing physics at the LHC, such as supersymmetry or interesting extensions which affect the Standard Model Higgs. Lastly, I'm fascinated by connections between modern experiments or observations and the early universe. By connecting the two, we stand to learn even more about what new physics that stands to be uncovered. I've spent time as a visitor at [Perimeter Insitute for Theoretical Physics](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/), [CERN](https://home.cern/), and [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/), and enjoy talking with others and hearing about their expertise!
